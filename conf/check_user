# /etc/pam.d/check_user
#   NOTE:   The current setup will only have the check_user application
#  	Check against pam_imap.so.  If you'd like to do a test run
#	with the rest of your authentication services, then uncomment
#	them in this file.  This will give a separate testing environment
# 	with pam_unix.so, or perhaps pam_krb5.so, and all your 
#	favorite friends in combination with pam_imap.  
#
#   Use	this for testing before adding to a vital service like sshd
#	or login...   you wouldn't want to accidently lock yourself
#	out would you?   ;-)
#
#	Make the file /etc/pam.d/imap-auth look similar to your 'system-auth'
#	file, but change the auth section to use pam_imap.so.
#	Any services that direct to 'service=imap-auth' will have the same
#	functionality.

#	This example config allows users to authentificate against imap 
#	server (eg. gmail) and user is authorised to access system if 
#	he already have local account with same username created 
#	(without domain part: eg. '@gmail.com').
#	User can still login to system with his local account password.
