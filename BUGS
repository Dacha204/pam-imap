BUGS BUGS BUGS...

--  0.3.6:  hashing table uses DES encryption for now... not too secure
	-- FIXED  using MD5 encryption now

-- 0.3.5:  this version kind of got lost in the development process  :)
	Skipped to 0.3.6

-- The server connect failover has not been thoroghly tested
	--  BUG FIXED
	When the server rollover hits the very last server, 
	I was having problems with some string checking for NULL,
	causing pam_imap.so to segfault when there were no servers
	left to check...  FIXED as of 0.3.4

-- Disallowed NULL passwords as of 0.3.4 --
	Explanation:  If you type in a username, before PAM asks
	you for your password (IE:  sm_authenticate() called )
	it sends a NULL (as in '\0') password to each authentication
	module.  This is why you see lines in your /var/log/messages
	that have something similar to
	"sshd(pam_unix)[22126]: authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser= rhost="
	This is because PAM is being a butthole for some reason.  This
	fix is a workaround for not hitting the IMAP server with
	a failed login EVERYTIME you want to log in.... it also
	makes the login process painfully slow.

	FIXED.

-- Security possiblity:  If hostnames are used in pam_imap.conf
	there may be opportunities for DNS hacking to spoof
	a malicious IMAP server that accepts a username/password
	Quick & Dirty solution:  Use IP addresses instead of 
	hostnames in pam_imap.conf
	Elegant solution:  Code pam_imap to only allow IP adresses

	-- Bug related to this: If a hostname is "unknown" to the
	client, then the module will segfault.  (somewhere in strcpy() )
		--FIXED

-- And, of course, if you use IMAP w/o SSL, that's just a whole
	can of worms there.
